Last updated: July 28, 2012

These Terms of Service (the "<strong>Terms</strong>") are a binding legal agreement between you and iWitness ("<strong>iWitness</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>"), regarding your use of our iWitness evidence recordation service (the "<strong>Service</strong>") that we provide through our application for the iPhone operating system (the "<strong>Application</strong>") and through our consumer Web site at www.iwitness.com (the "<strong>Website</strong>"). Please read these Terms carefully. These Terms supplement and incorporate our Licensed Application End User License Agreement that you agreed to when you downloaded and installed the Application.

We may periodically make changes to these Terms. By downloading and installing the application or accessing or using the Service, you accept these Terms and any modifications that we may make to the Terms. It is your responsibility to review the most recent version of the Terms frequently and remain informed of any changes to it. If you continue to use the Service after we modify these Terms, you will be deemed to have consented to terms of the modified Terms for your use of the Service as of the date of the modification. If you do not agree to any provision of these Terms, you must not use the Service.

<h4>1. The service</h4>
The Service allows you to use your iPhone to record video, photo, and audio footage, and to transmit it, together with your location information collected using your iPhone's global positioning system functionality, to a server where certain law enforcement agencies may access it. You also have the ability to access that recorded information on the iWitness website. The Licensed Application is not a substitute for good judgment and common sense, and it is not a 911 or emergency notification service. The Licensed Application must not be used to improperly stalk or harass anyone, and may not be used to monitor, or record data pertaining to, any person other than in the course of using the Licensed Application for its intended purposes. The Licensed Application is not intended for use by private investigators. The Licensed Application is not intended for use as a standalone self-defense tool, and it should not be relied upon as such. The Licensed Application is only intended for the collection of audio, video, and photographic evidence that may be used by authorized law enforcement personnel in apprehending and prosecuting criminal suspects.
<h4>2. Eligibility</h4>
You must be 18 years of age or older to use the Service. Use of the Service is void where prohibited. You represent and warrant that any profile information you submit is true and accurate and that you are 18 years of age or older and are fully able and competent to enter into, and abide by, these Terms. You can only use our Services if it is in fact legal for you to do so as determined by the laws of the country, state, and/or territory in which you live and access the Services.
<h4>3. Account Registration</h4>
You must log onto the Service via the Application in order to use it. You will be asked to create a user name and to select a password. These credentials are the same credentials that you will use to access any photos, video, and audio that you capture using the Service (collectively, "
<strong>Captured Content</strong>") on the Website. You will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@iwitness.com">info@iwitness.com</a>.

We value your privacy and are dedicated to protecting your information and providing you with notice about our information collection and use practices.

When you register for an account for the Service, you provide us with certain personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"), including, without limitation, your email address, stated name, phone number, mailing address, physical attributes and friend and family information.

We use Personal Information to respond to your inquiries, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze our application and the Service, and to customize our Service. We may use Personal Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personal Information to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.

We also collect various categories of non-personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, information about our users' hardware, devices, and usage of the Application and Service, such as use data, device ID, device type, application name, and version information. We use this information for purposes such as analyzing device compatibility, understanding trends in use of the Application and Service, and similar purposes. We also may prepare, publish, and disseminate reports, and other non-personally identifiable information derived therefrom to third parties. We and third parties may use non-personally identifiable information for various purposes.

From time to time we provide information about our products and services to our customers in the form of email and/or phone text message. Announcement emails will be emailed directly to the address that you provide when you register or sign into the Service. You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails by clicking on the link in the email, or providing us notice at <a href="mailto:info@iwitness.com">info@iwitness.com</a>. Even if you opt-out from receiving promotional email from us, you may continue to receive administrative communications from us regarding the Application and the Service.

We may place email links or forms in the Application, the Service, or the Website that allow you to contact us directly. The Personal Information you provide in these links and forms is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments for use later in improving the application or Service, or our other products or services, or we may review and discard the Personal Information. All information other than Personal Information that you send to us using these email links or forms will not be considered or treated as confidential information. Do not send us any information, ideas, suggestions, proposals, or comments that you consider confidential or that you want to be treated as confidential.

If the email address you provide us is an email address that you access via a wireless device, you understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time and elect to not receive such messages. You also represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which the messages may be received, and that you understand and are authorized to approve the applicable charges.

You may choose to allow the Service to provide alerts. Should you allow the Service to provide alerts, you understand and agree that this service may be provided using services operated outside of the Service, including, but not limited to, systems such as Apple's Push Notification Service. You understand and agree that pertinent data needed for such alerts will be transmitted and temporarily be stored on services operated by us, and that at the appropriate time, this alert data will be transmitted via corresponding services, e.g., Apple's Push Notification Service, for delivery to your device or chosen delivery endpoints. At no time is the Personal Information you provide transmitted via the third-party delivery service unless as required by the nature of the delivery mechanism (electronic mail, for example, requires your name and email address for delivery). Should you disagree with the mechanism of this service, you agree to disable and not use alerts that may be provided in the Service.

We may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to prevent injury or property damage. We will usually attempt to notify you when we are making such a disclosure, but we may not do so in an emergency or when we are prohibited by law or court order from giving such notice.

We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies without your consent unless we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce these Terms or any other agreements (including investigation of potential violations thereof), or (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.

We may provide services for the Service through contractual arrangements with affiliates, service providers, and other third parties ("Service Partners"). We and our Service Partners use your Personal Information to operate and deliver such products and services. Unless otherwise agreed by you in a separate agreement, our Service Partners are required to use your Personal Information to operate and deliver such products and services only, and are prohibited from using your Personal Information to inform you of other products or services available from those Service Partners.

If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information involved in such transactions and provide reasonable notice before Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Such notice may be given by a clear and concise statement on our website, in a subsequent update to the application that there has been an update to this privacy policy, or by email or other communication using contact information you have provided to us.

The Service may include links to other sites (for example, through advertisements displayed by the Service). Any information you submit to linked sites will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if any. You should review those policies carefully before providing any information to these linked sites.

We
undertake practical and reasonable steps to protect Personal Information from unauthorized or accidental access, disclosure, misuse or processing, or from alteration, destruction, or loss.

Should we decide to change this privacy policy, we will provide you with notice.

<h4>17. General Legal Notices</h4>
Our failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive our ability to act with respect to that circumstance or similar circumstances. Any provision of these Terms that is found to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable will be severed from these Terms, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue to be in full force and effect. The section headings and titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any provision in these Terms that by its nature should survive the termination of your license to access the Service or any termination of these Terms (including, without limitation, provisions governing indemnification, limitations on liability, disclaimers of warranty, and ownership of intellectual property) will continue to remain in full force and effect after any such termination.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, excluding conflict of laws principles. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the application, the Service, or these Terms must be commenced within one year after the claim arose and will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis, and will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration will be conducted in King County, Washington, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court of competent jurisdiction. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by Washington law. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party's rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.

These Terms, along with the Licensed Application End User License Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the application and the Service and supersede all prior agreements or communications between you and us regarding the subject matter of these Terms.
